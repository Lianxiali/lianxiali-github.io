I am a Postdoctoral Research Associate at the University of North Carolina (UNC) at Chapel Hill. I have been working on NIH-funded projects developing CFD models for cardiovascular flows and applying advanced FSI methods
to heart valve simulations. 

My Research Interests
======
My research specialty and interests focus on efficient and accurate fluid-structure interaction(FSI) modeling and its applications in various engineering fields. Central to my work is developing novel Computational Fluid Dynamics (CFD) models and their application to complex flow phenomena such as turbulence, multiphase flow, heart blood flow, etc. My research spans theoretical model development, computational implementation, and experimental validation, with applications ranging from mechanical engineering to civil engineering to biomedical engineering.
