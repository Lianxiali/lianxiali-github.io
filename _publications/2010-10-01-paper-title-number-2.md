excerpt: 'In this study, we propose a novel method utilizing nanobubbles (NBs) to assist in liquid phase exfoliation. The size, thickness, and number of layers of the resulting graphene solution were characterized and quantified. A highly concentrated graphene solution was achieved through ultrasonic processing in deionized (DI) water, without the need for any surfactant. The observed increase in yield can be attributed to the heightened cavitation within the NBs solution. This study presents a sustainable and cost-effective approach for the large-scale production of graphene, aligning with green and eco-friendly principles.'
